# SimpleReg 

SimpleReg is a Python-based open-source toolkit that provides tools helpful for (medical) image registration and processing. Interfaces to the following registration frameworks are available:

* [SimpleITK][simpleitk]
* [NiftyReg][niftyreg]
* [FLIRT][fsl]
* [ITK_NiftyMIC][itkniftymic] as an extension to [WrapITK][wrapitk]

The algorithm and software were developed by [Michael Ebner][mebner]
at the [Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences][weiss], [University College London (UCL)][ucl] (2015 -- 2019), and the [Department of Surgical and Interventional Sciences][sie], [King's College London (KCL)][kcl] (since 2019).

If you have any questions or comments, please drop an email to `michael.ebner@kcl.ac.uk`.
